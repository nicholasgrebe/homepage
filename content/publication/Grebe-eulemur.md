title: "Grebe, N.M., Sheikh, A., Ohannessian, L., & Drea, C.M. (2022). Effects of Oxytocin Receptor Blockade on Dyadic Social Behavior in Monogamous and Non-Monogamous Eulemur. bioRxiv."
abstract: "A prominent body of research spanning disciplines has been focused on the potential underlying role for oxytocin in the social signatures of monogamous mating bonds. Behavioral differences between monogamous and non-monogamous vole species, putatively mediated by oxytocinergic function, constitute a key source of support for this mechanism, but it is unclear to what extent this hormoneâ€“behavior linkage extends to the primate order. In a preregistered experiment, we test if oxytocin receptor blockade affects affiliative behavior in mixed-sex pairs of Eulemur, a genus of strepsirrhine primate containing both monogamous and non-monogamous species. Inconsistent with past studies in monogamous voles or monkeys, we do not find confirmatory evidence in Eulemur that monogamous pairs affiliate more than non-monogamous pairs, nor that oxytocin receptor blockade of one pair member selectively corresponds to reduced affiliative or scent-marking behavior in monogamous species. We do, however, find exploratory evidence of a pattern not previously investigated: simultaneously blocking oxytocin receptors in both members of a monogamous pair predicts lower rates of affiliative behavior relative to controls. Our study demonstrates the value of non-traditional animal models in challenging generalizations based on model organisms, and of methodological reform in providing a potential path forward for behavioral oxytocin research."
