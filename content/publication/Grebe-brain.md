abstract: "Contemporary theory that emphasizes the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in mammalian sociality
has been shaped by seminal vole research that revealed interspecific variation in neuroendocrine
circuitry by mating system. However, substantial challenges exist in interpreting and translating
these rodent findings to other mammalian groups, including humans, making research on nonhuman
primates crucial. Both monogamous and non-monogamous species exist within *Eulemur*, a genus of
strepsirrhine primate, offering a rare opportunity to broaden a comparative perspective on oxytocin
and vasopressin neurocircuitry with increased evolutionary relevance to humans. We performed
oxytocin and arginine vasopressin 1a receptor autoradiography on 12 *Eulemur* brains from seven
closely related species to (1) characterize receptor distributions across the genus, and (2) examine
differences between monogamous and non-monogamous species in regions part of putative “pairbonding
circuits”. We find some binding patterns across *Eulemur* reminiscent of olfactory-guided
rodents, but others congruent with more visually oriented anthropoids, consistent with lemurs
occupying an ‘intermediary’ evolutionary niche between haplorhine primates and other mammalian
groups. We find little evidence of a “pair-bonding circuit” in Eulemur akin to those proposed in previous
rodent or primate research. Mapping neuropeptide receptors in these nontraditional species questions
existing assumptions and informs proposed evolutionary explanations about the biological bases of
monogamy."
