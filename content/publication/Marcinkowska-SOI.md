abstract: "The psychological construct of sociosexuality—one's sexual openness or propensity to engage in uncommitted sexual relationships—has been broadly examined within numerous cultures and mating contexts. Although there is some evidence suggesting that components of sociosexuality, namely behavior, desire and attitude, change within-person, relatively little research has investigated potential sources of such variation. The aim of our study was to explore if the individual components of sociosexuality change across the menstrual cycle, either as a function of cycle phase or ovarian hormones. One hundred and two naturally cycling women, both single and in a committed relationships, completed questions from the the SOI-R (Sociosexuality Revised) questionnaire three times during a menstrual cycle, scheduled to coincide with their early follicular, peri-ovulatory, and luteal phases. Women provided saliva samples and performed luteinizing hormone tests to distinguish between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. Women reported slightly more openness to uncommitted sexual relationships during the peri-ovulatory session, but significant differences were restricted only to women who exhibited the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovarian hormone concentrations within cycles significantly predicted SOI Attitude and Desire scores, with estradiol positively related, and progesterone negatively related to openness to uncommitted sexuality. These effects were generally modest in size. The results of this study suggest that sociosexuality can vary within short periods of time, such as a single menstrual cycle."
