Decades of research in behavioral endocrinology has implicated the gonadal hormone testosterone in the regulation
of mating effort, often expressed in primates in the form of aggressive and/or status-striving behavior.
Based on the idea that neuroendocrine axes influence each other, recent work among humans has proposed that
links between testosterone and indices of status-striving are rendered conditional by the effects of glucocorticoids.
The Dual Hormone hypothesis is one particular instance of this argument, predicting that cortisol blocks
the effects of testosterone on dominance, aggression, and risk-taking in humans. Support for the Dual Hormone
hypothesis is wide-ranging, but considerations of theoretical ambiguity, null findings, and low statistical power
pose problems for interpreting the published literature. Here, we contribute to the development of the Dual
Hormone hypothesis by (1) critically reviewing the extant literature—including p-curve analyses of published
findings; and, (2) “opening the file drawer” and examining relationships between testosterone, cortisol, and
status-striving personality features in seven previously published studies from our laboratories (total N=718;
median N per feature=318) that examined unrelated predictions. Results from p-curve suggest that published
studies have only 16% power to detect effects, while our own data show no robust interactions between testosterone
and cortisol in predicting status-striving personality features. We discuss the implications of these
results for the Dual Hormone hypothesis, limitations of our analyses, and the development of future research.
