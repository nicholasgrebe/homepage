I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/anthro), and member of the [Rosenbaum Lab](https://www.primatebehaviorlab.com/). My research interests focus on the evolution of social and mating behavior, with a particular emphasis on hormonal mechanisms. I'm a big believer in the value of interdisciplinary perspectives--in my work, I draw from theory and methods in social psychology, comparative neuroscience, ethology, and evolutionary biology. I have ongoing research projects regarding the interplay between hormones and pair-bonding in human couples; the role of oxytocin in the evolution of lemur social behavior; increasing openness, transparency, and collaboration in the behavioral sciences; and the physiology and form of gorilla social relationships.
