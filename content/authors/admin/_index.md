I'm an Assistant Professor of Psychology at [Occidental College](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/psychology). My research interests focus on the evolution of social and mating behavior, with a particular emphasis on hormonal mechanisms. I'm a big believer in the value of interdisciplinary perspectives--in my work, I draw from theory and methods in behavioral ecology, comparative neuroscience, social psychology, and evolutionary biology. I have ongoing research projects regarding the physiology and form of gorilla social relationships; the interplay between hormones and pair-bonding in human couples; the role of oxytocin in the evolution of lemur social behavior; and increasing openness, transparency, and collaboration in the behavioral sciences.
